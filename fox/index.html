						LONDON, BRITAIN <sup>â€”</sup> Riots broke out around 10 Downing street as English citizens became unhappy with their current Prime Minister.
					</p>
					<p>
						Citizens are gathered around the door armed with makeshift weapons, such as tea kettles and fine china. Due to Britain's overly-restrictive gun laws, they do not have the ability to wield actual weapons.

						A questioning with a passing Englishman suggest their less than savoury intentions:
					</p>
					<p>
						"Maybe if we weren't treated so badly, we wouldn't have to resort to this!"
					</p>
					<p>
						When questioned what "this" represents, he answered that they are planning on reforming the government from the bottom up.
					</p>
					<p>
