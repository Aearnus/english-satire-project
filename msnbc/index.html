						LONDON, ENGLAND — EXCLUSIVE REPORT — Correspondants in England have given us word that rebellions in England have been sparked in response to recent decisions made by the British Prime Minister.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Prime Minister had introduced a social assistance program, which had sparked unreasonable and groundless backlash from the community. This backlash manifested itself into a dangerous gathering in front of the Prime Minister's office. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Gladly, thanks to England's sane gun control laws, none of the possibly violent protesters had access to any lethal weapons. Many of the protesters were armed with clipboards and paper, though. Witness accounts reported violent waving of the clipboards and threating gestures of paper, slicing back and forth.
